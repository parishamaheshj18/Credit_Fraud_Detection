# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The main models used in this project are **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, which are widely known for their robustness in classification problems.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to accurately detect fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card transactions. Fraudulent activities in credit card transactions can be financially damaging, and identifying them early is crucial for financial security.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions representing only 0.172% of all transactions.

### Models Used

1. **Random Forest**:
   - A powerful ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

2. **XGBoost**:
   - An advanced gradient boosting algorithm that performs remarkably well on imbalanced datasets due to its ability to minimize loss functions and regularize models effectively.


## Getting Started
